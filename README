QEMU is a free and open-source emulator. It emulates the machine's processor through dynamic binary translation and provides a set of different hardware and device models for the machine, enabling it to run a variety of guest operating systems.

It may be very out of date, but the Pocket PC source code might be usefull.

I have gotten it to run Windows 3.1 although with a General Protection Fault in PROGMAN.exe but runs Windows 95 slowly but surely.
